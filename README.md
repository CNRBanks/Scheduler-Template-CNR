# Scheduler-Template-CNR

## Description

My goal was to create a scheduler application that users could easily update with their own time frame  and activities.
This site allows users to enter text within a given time frame to schedule events in the past, present, and future.

## Usage

Users can enter information into each time block and save that information. If the user closes out and revisits the page their notes will be continue to be visible. Each time block is color coded depending on the current time for easy legibility.
